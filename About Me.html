	<h1>NBA Basketball</h1>
	<p> Basketball became my first passion. I spent so long trying to learn what I found passionate within my life. But during high school I was able to find what that was which happened to be NBA basketball.</p>

	<h2>Research</h2>
	<p> I spent hours searching up information on basketball when I was first learning it. I would stay up until 5 am almost everyday just fascinated by Allen Iverson, Durant, Lebron and etc.</p>
